# CLINICAL_REASONING_SLM

## Overview

**CLINICAL_REASONING_SLM** is a specialized project focused on fine-tuning a T5 Base Small Language Model (SLM) for clinical reasoning tasks involving medical descriptions. This repository combines the power of transformer-based natural language processing with domain-specific clinical knowledge to create an efficient, fast-inference model optimized for healthcare applications.

The project addresses the critical need for lightweight yet accurate AI models in clinical settings, where computational resources may be limited but precision is paramount. By leveraging the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) architecture and adapting it specifically for clinical reasoning, this implementation bridges the gap between general-purpose language models and specialized medical AI applications.
